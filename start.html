			<p>Disc Golf is a sport that follows a lot of the rules of another popular sport Golf. You use specially crafted throwing disc and count the number of throws it take to get it in the hole commonly referred to as the basket. A like golf a course a disc golf course typically contains 18 holes and the distance from tee to basket can be between 300-500 feet or more. At the end of each hole you tally your throws on a score sheet and at the end of 18 hole the one with the least about of throw wins.</p>
			<p> Here is an article  to help you brush up on your disc golf <a href="https://www.discgolf.com/disc-golf-education-development/disc-golf-terminology/">Terminology</a>.</p>

				<h3>Were to begin?</h3>
				<p>Unlike regular golf you can start started with a relatively low amount of investment. Basic disc can average between $8-11 and to get a good feel for the game it is best to pick up two to three disc’s of the different types. At most it might cost you just shy of $27-30 and at least if you only want one disc to start $8-10. You certainly can go much higher than that when you get into the other options like type of plastic and other features like a rubberized brim but you don’t have to worry about that for now. Also, did I mention that most disc golf courses are in local parks and are absolutely free to use.</p>

				<h4>How to pick a disc?</h4>
				<img class="image_golfer" src="http://www.explorediscgolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Misc.-091-735x551.jpg">
				<p> This can some seem daunting at first especially if you get yourself lost in some of the many charts out there for disc’s. I would worry too much about the charts and numbers for now what you should concern yourself more about is the types.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="div_sub_section">
				<h4>Types</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Distance Driver: Your bread and butter for long range shots and what you typically use for your starting throw. Keep in mind these tend require a little more finesse to throw so it may not be best to start out with it when you are just learning to throw.</li>
					<li>Mid-range: you typically use this for your follow up throws where you want more control for a little less distance. can be a good starter</li>
					<li>Putter/approach: This is the disc you use when you’re getting ready to score typically when your less than 30 feet from the basket. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="div_sub_section">
				<h4>Weight</h4>
				<p>One of the most important and often overlooked feature of a disc is its weight. Disc can weigh anywhere for 175 grams at the max to the more beginner class of 150 grams lower. Weight can drastically effect your throw distance and it is surprising how even as much as little of 25g can make. It is best to start with the lighter disc as to the unconditioned arm a heavier disc can really kill your distance, I learned this the hard way. Ultimate the distance is only as good as your ability to throw the disc effectively which we will get into next.</p>

			<h3>The Quick rules/tips.</h3>

			<h4>Tips</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Practice often, especially your throw and form</li>
				<li>Never get too attached to a disc because courses commonly have water hazards or tall grass and trees and it can be very easy especially starting out to lose a disc.</li>
				<li>Before you do lose your disc, it is good write your name and number on it in the event someone finds it and returns it.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Top three rules</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Be aware of other golfers you might have to wait your turn at a hole or wait for the people ahead of you to finish.</li>
				<li>If you’re in a large group and you have single person or vary small group waiting behind you it is polite to let them play through.</li>
				<li>If the is a name and number on the disc, please attempt to return the disc to the original owner. </li>
			</ol>

			<h3>The  Summary.</h3>
			<p>In closing disc golf, can be cheap to start out and a lot of fun with a group of friends. Picking a disc can feel overwhelming with all the number codes, options, types and different material’s. starting out it is best to go with the cheaper, lighter, and less durable plastic disc’s as you can often lose them and are still learning. It can take some time to nail down the form so have patience. Lastly, be kind courteous of other golfers and aware of your surroundings.</p>
