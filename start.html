			<p class="side_p">Disc Golf is a sport that follows a lot of the rules of another popular sport, Golf. You use specially crafted throwing disc and count the number of throws it take to get it in the hole commonly referred to as the basket. Like golf a course a disc golf course typically contains 18 holes and the distance from tee to basket can be between 300-500 feet or more. At the end of each hole you tally your throws on a score sheet and at the end of 18 hole the person with the least about of throws wins.</p>

			<h3>How to get stated?</h3>
		<section class="sub_section">

			<h3>Were to begin?</h3>
			<p>Unlike regular golf you can start started with a relatively low amount of investment. Basic disc can average between $8-11 and to get a good feel for the game it is best to pick up two to three disc’s of the different types. At most it might cost you just shy of $27-30 and at least $8-10 if you only want one disc to start. You certainly can go much higher than that when you get into the other options, type of plastic, rubberized brim, weight, ect. You don’t have to worry about that for now. Also, did I mention that most disc golf courses are in local parks and are absolutely free to use.</p>

				<h4>How to pick a disc?</h4>
				<img class="image_golfer" src="http://www.explorediscgolf.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Misc.-091-735x551.jpg">
				<p class="side_p"> This can some seem daunting at first especially if you get yourself lost in some of the many charts out there for disc’s. I would worry too much about the charts and numbers for now what you should concern yourself more about is the types.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="div_sub_section">
				<h4>Types</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Distance Driver: Your bread and butter for long range shots and what you typically use for a starting throw. Keep in mind these tend require a little more finesse to throw so it may not be best to start out with it when you are just learning to throw.</li>
					<li>Mid-range: you typically use this for your follow up throws where you want more control for a little less distance. Mid-range can be a great for starting out.</li>
					<li>Putter/approach: This is the disc you use when you’re getting ready to score. Typically this is when your less than 30 feet from the basket. </li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="div_sub_section">
				<h4>Weight</h4>
				<p>One of the most important and often overlooked feature of a disc is its weight. Disc can weigh anywhere for 175 grams at the max to the more beginner class of 150 grams or lower. Weight can drastically effect your throw distance. It is surprising how even as little as 25g can make a big difference. It is best to start with the lighter discs. For the unconditioned a heavier disc can really kill distance, I learned this the hard way. Ultimately the distance is only as good as your ability to throw the disc effectively which we will get into next.</p>

			<h3>The  Summary.</h3>
			<p>In closing disc golf, can be very affordable start out and is a lot of fun with a group of friends. Picking a disc can feel overwhelming with all the number codes, options, types and different material’s so try not to get too bogged down. starting out it is best to go with the cheaper, lighter, and less durable plastic disc’s as you can often lose them and are still learning. It can take some time to nail down the form so have patience. Lastly, be kind courteous of other golfers and be aware of your surroundings.</p>
